# How to create Logical Cluster 

There are 2 ways to define a Logical cluster:
* Include all details of each cluster into Logical Cluster. See example: [Detailed Logical Cluster](/docs/sample/logical-cluster/logical-cluster-detailed.yml)
* Define a Cluster Catalog and reuse Cluster Catalog for each cluster or several clusters. See example: [Logical cluster using CLuster Catalog](/docs/sample/logical-cluster/logical-cluster-cluster-catalog.yml) and [Cluster Catalogs](/docs/sample/logical-cluster/cluster-catalogs.yml)
